      Hi! I'm also a writer. Specifically, I'm 

      <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
      a staff writer for <a href="https://thetech.com/">The Tech</a>, 
      </pre>

      <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
      a former literary spread lead for <a href="https://infinitemagazine.mit.edu/">Infinite magazine</a>,
      </pre>

      <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
      and a casual enjoyer of fiction. I tend towards flash fiction and short-form, but a novel is in the works!

      <p>a poem published online in Double Yolk! this stanza is still...strangely cool:

        <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
        I see her friends mindlessly nod
        At the vivid details of her recent travels to a city
        Under lockdown. They praise her volunteerism
        At the dilapidated soup kitchen she’s never visited.
        </pre>

        it sort of reminds me of this part of Taylor Swift's song, seven:

        <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
        Please picture me
        In the trees
        I hit my peak at seven feet
        In the swing
        Over the creek
        I was too scared to jump in
        But I, I was high 
        in the sky
